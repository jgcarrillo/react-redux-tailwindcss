# React - Redux - TailwindCSS

This is a **dummy application** to improve my React and Redux skills. I'm sure it has several errors and it needs to be improved but for me it was worth it because I learned a lot doing it.

### ðŸš© Main goal

The aim was to create an app that used _Redux_ as a state manager for share data between components such as the number of PokÃ©mons added. I have created **two reducers**, one for the PokÃ©mons and other for the cart.

Once the PokÃ©mon list is fetched from the [API](https://pokeapi.co/) the data is displayed in a table. Then, you can add PokÃ©mons (without repetition) inside the cart.

In the cart view, you can see the details of a specific PokÃ©mons or you can remove it from the cart.

The Home view will show the image of PokÃ©mons added to the cart or a message if the cart is empty.

### ðŸš€ Improvements

This is an on-the-fly list of all the cool things to improve on the app.

- Add a spinner for the PokÃ©mon fetch data.
- Improve the add button. When you add a new PokÃ©mon to the cart, the add button will be disabled.
- Add a spinner for the PokÃ©mon details.
